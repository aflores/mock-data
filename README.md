Limits
To be able to provide a free service to as many people as possible during this phase, the project comes with a few limits:

Changes are faked and aren't persisted (just like JSONPlaceholder)
Requests are cached (1 minute)
db.json has limits
All servers are public
Private GitHub repositories aren't supported (yet)
